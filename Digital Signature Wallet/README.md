🧪 An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

⚙️ Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Foundry/Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🪝 **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- 🧱 [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **WalletConnect/Reown Integration**: Connect to 700+ wallets via WalletConnect Network with seamless wallet connections.

## 🔗 WalletConnect/Reown Integration

This project is fully compatible with **WalletConnect** and **Reown** (formerly WalletConnect Inc.) for seamless wallet connections.

### Wallet Support

The app uses **RainbowKit** which is built on top of **WalletConnect/Reown**, enabling connections to:
- **700+ wallets** via the WalletConnect Network
- **65,000+ apps** across EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, and more
- Direct connections to popular wallets: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger, Rainbow, Safe, and more

### Configuration

The project is pre-configured with WalletConnect/Reown for secure wallet connections:
- **WalletConnect Project ID**: Uses default project ID - works out of the box, no setup required
- **Network Support**: Hardhat (local development) and other EVM-compatible networks
- **Ready to Use**: All default values are configured and ready for immediate use

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install the latest version of Scaffold-ETH 2

```
npx create-eth@latest
```

This command will install all the necessary packages and dependencies, so it might take a while.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also initialize your project with one of our extensions to add specific features or starter-kits. Learn more in our [extensions documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/extensions/).

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network that runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. Learn how to [customize your network configuration](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#1-initialize-a-local-blockchain).

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. You can find more information about how to customize your contract and deployment script in our [documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#2-deploy-your-smart-contract).

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
